Regina Sungkeong Kim holds a bachelor's degree in Music Composition and two master's degrees: one in Music Therapy Education (MEd) and another in Psychology and Education (MA). During her first master's program, she trained as a music therapist, using music and visual cues to support language development and hearing rehabilitation in deaf children. This experience sparked her interest in the brain's audiovisual synchrony, particularly the relationship between pitch and the height of visual cues. She is currently a research assistant in the NEURECA Lab, studying how music features and visual cues may influence emotional environments in schools.
