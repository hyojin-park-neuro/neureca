I am a Human Neuroscience BSc student at the University of Birmingham, working within Hyojin's team for my final year dissertation project. I did my year abroad at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Australia, and am back in Birmingham for my 3rd year! My final year project will involve looking at human cross-modal emotional responses to art and music.
