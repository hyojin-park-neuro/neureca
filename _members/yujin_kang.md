Yujin Kang is a second-year Ph.D. student under the supervision of Dr. Yoon-Sik Cho at Chung-Ang University, South Korea. Her research focuses on probing and enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), with particular attention to their vulnerabilities and robustness in real-world applications. She is especially interested in the intersection of LLM reasoning, security, and privacy, exploring how advanced LLMs behave in complex decision-making environments where safety, trust, and domain specificity are critical.
