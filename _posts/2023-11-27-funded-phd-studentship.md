They should have a commitment to research in neuroimaging and mental health and hold or realistically expect to obtain at least an Upper Second Class Honours Degree and ideally masterâ€™s degree in a relevant subject.

***Essential skills:***
- At least 1st class or 2:1 degree classification in relevant areas (MSc degree is a plus but we will consider students with a BSc degree) 
- Degree in psychology, neuroscience, mental health, medicine, physics, computer science, experimental linguistics or a related discipline relevant to cognitive neuroscience/neuroimaging 
- Relevant academic or non-academic experience or expertise relevant to the research project 
- Excellent English language skills
- Strong organisation and time-management skills
- Strong commitment, flexibility, independence
- A positive problem-solving attitude and strong teamwork skills

***Desirable skills:***
- Experience with cognitive neuroscience research (human electrophysiology using MEG/EEG/OPM-MEG or other)
- Programming skills (MATLAB, Python, R or similar)
- Knowledge of general statistics for data analysis 
- Notes: These are skills that will be required to complete the PhD. However, we will also consider applicants who do not yet have these skills but are highly motivated to learn them during the project.
