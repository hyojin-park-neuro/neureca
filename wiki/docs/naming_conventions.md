# Naming Conventions

## Journal Papers and Powerpoint Slides

It's important to have consistent filenames when saving files. The format structure we use is : 

First-Author's-Surname_Year_Title.file-extention

EXAMPLES:

When saving a pdf:

```
Park_2018_Representational interactions during audiovisual speech entrainment.pdf
```

When saving a powerpoint:

```
Park_2018_Representational interactions during audiovisual speech entrainment.pptx
```

If the title is too long then use the short title or cut it off.
